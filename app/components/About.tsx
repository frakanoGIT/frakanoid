        Hey there, I&apos;m Franky, chilling in Jakarta, Indonesia. I&apos;ve
        got this thing for tech and coding; it&apos;s like a puzzle I can&apos;t
        stop solving. Manga and anime? Absolutely my jam &#x2d; those stories
        are wild! And let&apos;s not forget gaming, especially Nintendo games
        &#x2d; they&apos;ve got me hooked. Life&apos;s all about learning and
        diving into new adventures, whether it&apos;s lines of code, gripping
        plots, or virtual escapades. So, ready to explore the unknown with me?
